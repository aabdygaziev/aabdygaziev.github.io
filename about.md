My name is Aktan. I am originally from Kyrgyzstan. In 2016, I moved to Boston, to study International Business and Finance at Hult International Business School. After business school, I worked as a Business Analyst at a biotech startup in Boston.

In summer 2019, I decided to join Flatiron School's full-time intensive Data Science program. After completing the program I got interested in deep learning and computer vision. Currently, I am seeking entry level opportunities.
